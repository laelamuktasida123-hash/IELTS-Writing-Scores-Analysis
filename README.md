# IELTS Writing Scores Analysis : Extracting Insights from Test Taker's Essays 
A capstone project analyzing IELTS Writing Task 1 & 2 essays to uncover patterns in scoring, essay structure, vocabulary, and grammar usage, with AI-assisted summarization for actionable insights.

### 📊 Project Overview
- *Dataset*: IELTS Writing Task 1 & 2 essays  
- *Revenue*: 1.000+ esai
- *Score*: 1.0 – 9.0 ( IELTS Standards )
- *Scope*: Score patterns, clause complexity, tense usage, vocabulary diversity, and essay length.
- *Source*:(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mazlumi/ielts-writing-scored-essays-dataset)
  
This project transforms raw essay data into *actionable insights* that help understand factors contributing to higher scores, improve feedback mechanisms, and support EFL (English as a Foreign Language) learning.

### ⚙️ Methodology
1. *Data Preprocessing & Cleaning*  
   - Handling missing values, cleaning text, standardizing essay formatting.  
2. *Feature Engineering*  
   - Extract essay length, tense usage, clause complexity, vocabulary diversity.  
3. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*  
   - Visualizations: histogram, scatter plot, boxplot  
   - Analyze score distribution, essay length correlation, tense patterns, clause comlexity patterns.
4. *AI Summarization*  
   - IBM Granite used to generate automated summary insights from essay analysis.

### 🛠️ Tools Used
- *Python & Pandas* → Data manipulation and analysis  
- *Matplotlib & Seaborn* → Data visualization  
- *Google Colab* → Cloud-based interactive coding environment  
- *IBM Granite* → Large language model for AI summarization  
- *Replicate & LangChain* → API integration for AI workflow automation  


### 🔑 Key Findings
- *Score distribution*: Majority of essays scored between 5.0 – 7.0  
- *Essay length*: Positive correlation with score  
- *Task type impact*: Task 2 (Argumentative) tends to have higher median scores  
- *Grammar & Tense usage*: Higher-scoring essays use more varied tenses (Present Perfect, Past Perfect, Future)  
- *Clause complexity*: Essays with complex/compound-complex clauses score higher  
- *Vocabulary richness*: Higher-scoring essays use more diverse words with fewer repetitions  

### 💡 Insights for Learning
- Focus on *clause complexity* and *tense variety* to improve essay scores  
- Encourage *balanced use of active and passive voice*  
- Build *vocabulary diversity* to enhance lexical resource scoring  
- Longer and clear essays, when structured well, are likely to score higher  

### 📈 Recommendations
- *Teaching Strategy*: Include exercises for complex sentence construction, tense variation, and vocabulary enrichment  
- *Feedback System*: Automated essay scoring + AI-generated summary for quick insights
